# Summary

As an experienced Web2 builder, I’m equally comfortable managing tech teams and collaborating with others on design and strategies, discussing solutions with stakeholders, and deploying products. I’m seeking out a role where my experience and existing skills can make a direct contribution as quickly, but also provide me with new challenges to continue to grow as a developer and a leader.  I want to take the opportunity to contribute to building Web3.
